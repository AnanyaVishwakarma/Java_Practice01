/*Let the function f(s) be the frequency of the lexicographically smallest character in a non-empty string s. 
For example, if s = "dcce" then f(s) = 2 because the lexicographically smallest character is 'c', which has a frequency of 2.
You are given an array of strings words and another array of query strings queries. 
For each query queries[i], count the number of words in words such that f(queries[i]) < f(W) for each W in words.
Return an integer array answer, where each answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.
Example 1:

Input: queries = ["cbd"], words = ["zaaaz"]
Output: [1]
Explanation: On the first query we have f("cbd") = 1, f("zaaaz") = 3 so f("cbd") < f("zaaaz").
Example 2:

Input: queries = ["bbb","cc"], words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: On the first query only f("bbb") < f("aaaa"). On the second query both f("aaa") and f("aaaa") are both > f("cc").
